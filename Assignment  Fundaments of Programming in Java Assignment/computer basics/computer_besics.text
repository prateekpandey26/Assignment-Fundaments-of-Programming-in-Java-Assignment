1. what is computer?

answer=
A computer is an electronic machine that has the capacity to accept, store, and process data and execute a range of actions following instructions which are known as programs. It comprises hardware (the physical parts such as cpu, memory, disk storage, and input/output units) and software (the programs and operating systems).

In simple words, computers can add and subtract, remember and access information, go on the world wide web and much more. They are useful in many areas such as homes and business houses, scientific research and fun games. Is there something in particular about computers that you would want to get acquainted with?

2. What do you mean by RAM

answer=

RAM or Random Access Memory, is a kind of temporary or volatile memory present in computers and such devices. It helps the Central Processing Unit (CPU) run applications by retaining information temporarily. Here are some characteristics of RAM made easy:

Volatile Memory: When power is removed, RAM does contain data and information, unlike storages such as hard drives or SSDs.

Speed: It is always faster than other unconventional storage devices, hence there is a speedy retrieval of information which augments system performance.

Capacity: The capacity of RAM determines the number of applications that can be used at once and the degree of effectiveness they function. More RAM is usually helpful when using many programs or performing complicated tasks.

Types: The most common types of random access memory are Double Data Rate DDR2, DDR3, DDR4, and modern DDR5 up rassing costs else speed of data transfers.

3. where is data stored in the computer?

answer= there are several different types of memory in our computer where our data is stored ,some of them are following

Hard Disk Drive (HDD) / Solid State Drive (SSD): These are primary storage devices where data is permanently stored. HDDs use magnetic disks, while SSDs use flash memory for faster access.

RAM (Random Access Memory)  = This is temporary storage that holds data and programs currently in use. It’s much faster than HDDs or SSDs but loses its data when the power is turned off.

Cache Memory = A small amount of high-speed memory located inside or near the CPU. It stores frequently accessed data and instructions to speed up processing.

Optical Discs = Such as CDs, DVDs, and Blu-rays, these are used for storing data that is not frequently changed.

External Storage = Devices like USB flash drives, external hard drives, and cloud storage services can also be used to store data and back it up.

Non-volatile Memory = Other forms of persistent storage, like EEPROM and flash storage, retain data even when powered off.

4. What is that input device used to type text and numbers on a document in the computer system?

answer = The input device used to type text and numbers on a document in a computer system is called a keyboard. It typically consists of keys for letters, numbers, and various functions that allow users to input data into the computer.

5. what are  output devices?

answer =
Output devices are hardware components that receive data from a computer and convert it into a form that can be understood by users. Common output devices include:

1 Monitor =Displays visual output, including text, images, and videos.
2 Printer= Produces physical copies of documents and images on paper.
3 Speakers = Output sound and audio signals.
4 Headphones= Provide personal audio output.
5 Projector = Projects visual output onto a larger screen or surface.
6 Plotter = Creates high-quality graphics and drawings, often used in engineering and architecture.

These devices allow users to receive and interpret the results of computer processing.

6.Which is the input device that allows a user to move the cursor or pointer on the screen? 

answer = The input device that allows a user to move the cursor or pointer on the screen is called a "mouse" It typically consists of buttons and a scroll wheel, enabling users to interact with graphical elements on the screen. Other devices that can also serve this purpose include touchpads (found on laptops) and trackballs.

7.which is the language that is directly understood by a computer without a translation program?

answer= 
The language that is directly understood by a computer without a translation program is called "machine language" (or machine code). This low-level language consists of binary code (0s and 1s) that the computer's hardware can execute directly. Each type of processor has its own specific machine language.

8. what are the input devises?

answer = 
Input devices are hardware components that allow users to enter data and commands into a computer system. Common examples include:

Keyboard: Used for typing text and numbers.
Mouse: A pointing device that allows users to interact with graphical elements on the screen.
Touchpad: A built-in pointing device on laptops that detects finger movements.
Scanner: Converts physical documents and images into digital format.
Microphone: Captures audio input for voice commands or recording.
Webcam: Captures video input for video conferencing and streaming.
Joystick: Often used for gaming, it allows for directional control.
Game controller: A device designed specifically for gaming, providing buttons and joysticks for input.
